      This is just a random paragraph that has nothing to do with anything.  The sun is so
      hot that it can melt anything, but the sun is not the only one out there.  There are
      are also stars out there that are even hotter than our sun.  Our sun is consider small
      compare to other suns.  There is the blue giant that is so much bigger than our sun that
      it makes our sun look like venus compare to it.
