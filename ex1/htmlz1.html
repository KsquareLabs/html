<h2>Akili Johnson Professor Dole English 1301 13 June 2016 Living up to loved
one&Otilde;s expectations can be extremely stressful yet motivational.
It&Otilde;s sort of like an oxymoron. Family members, mentors, teachers etc.
tend to set high standards for those they see potential in. This often results
in superiors and guardians dishing out harsher punishment creating character
and leadership attributes. &Ograve;After a moment I broke silence by telling
him my mother had begun to threaten me with military school if I didn&Otilde;t
get my grades and discipline together.&Oacute; (Moore 54) This states that a
parent is engraving standards and potential with in their child. Some can see
potential in you before you&Otilde;re able to fully discover your abilities and
talents; that&Otilde;s where the stress comes in. For example, a high school
teen whose battling with acceptance from their peers and approval from loved
ones can feel stressed out because they just want to enjoy their youth and
create memories with friends while their parents expects/wants them to buckle
down and study. Nobody wants to be a disappointment but that&Otilde;s sort of
inevitable when you&Otilde;re constantly aiming to achieve goals others have
set for you. This is where personal accountability comes in. Use the
expectations as motivation. Sort of like how performers feed off the crowd. The
performers know that their fans expect to see a great show. The fans display
their excitement with screams and sometimes tears when the performer first walk
on stage. The performer uses this energy and delivers a memorable experience
for their fans. Energy is neither created or destroyed, it&Otilde;s transferred
so redirecting the negative energy (stress) to positive energy (motivation) is
essential to succeeding. Poverty equals poor education. Schools in poverty
cities have less access to resources and technology needed to teach the
criteria required to move on to the next level. This lack of (Moore)essential
items causes many to have adversity in their life. The lack of proper education
can prevent some from certain jobs as well as restrict the opportunity to make
a reasonable pay wage to live a comfortable life. The relationship between
poverty and education is very interdependent. Poverty equals poor education;
Poor education equals poverty. (Moore) </h2>
