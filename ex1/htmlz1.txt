It’s sort of like an oxymoron. Family members, mentors, teachers etc. tend to set high standards for those they see potential in. This often results in superiors and guardians dishing out harsher punishment creating character and leadership attributes. “After a moment I broke silence by telling him my mother had begun to threaten me with military school if I didn’t get my grades and discipline together.” (Moore 54) This states that a parent is engraving standards and potential with in their child.      Some can see potential in you before you’re able to fully discover your abilities and talents; that’s where the stress comes in. For example, a high school teen whose battling with acceptance from their peers and approval from loved ones can feel stressed out because they just want to enjoy their youth and create memories with friends while their parents expects/wants them to buckle down and study. Nobody wants to be a disappointment but that’s sort of inevitable when you’re constantly aiming to achieve goals others have set for you. This is where personal accountability comes in. Use the expectations as motivation. Sort of like how performers feed off the crowd. The performers know that their fans expect to see a great show. The fans display their excitement with screams and sometimes tears when the performer first walk on stage. The performer uses this energy and delivers a memorable experience for their fans. Energy is neither created or destroyed, it’s transferred so redirecting the negative energy (stress) to positive energy (motivation) is essential to succeeding.       Poverty equals poor education. Schools in poverty cities have less access to resources and technology needed to teach the criteria required to move on to the next level. This lack of (Moore)essential items causes many to have adversity in their life. The lack of proper education can prevent some from certain jobs as well as restrict the opportunity to make a reasonable pay wage to live a comfortable life. The relationship between poverty and education is very interdependent.  Poverty equals poor education; Poor education equals poverty.  (Moore)      </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGoErIDq_4Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
